# Todo List Application(MEAN Stack)

This is an Angular application for managing a todo list with features like add, update (mark complete/pending), delete, and drag-and-drop reordering.

## Functionalities

- **Create Todos**: Users can add new todo items to the list.
- **Update Todos**: Users can mark existing todos as completed or pending.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can remove unwanted todos from the list.
- **Reorder Todos**: Users can drag and drop todo items to change their order in the list.
- **Real-time Updates**: The list reflects changes (addition, deletion, completion status) immediately without requiring a page refresh.

## TODO
- **Backend reordering implementation**: Add functionality to handle reordering of todo items. This will ensure that changes in the order are persisted in the database.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication functionality to secure the application. This will allow users to register, login, and manage their own todo lists securely.
